# JSONShell
A JSON Oriented Shell

# Goal
To create a shell to work with structured data.

# Status
This project is barely at a minimum-viable product level from the perspective of a language.
As a shell, it is not complete in its current stage, and is *not* recommended as a daily driver.

# Getting Started
1. Install [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
2. Clone this repository
    `git clone https://github.com/faber7/JSONShell.git`
3. Change directory to `/Shell`
4. Use `dotnet run` to start the shell. To exit, press Ctrl+D, or type `System.Exit` into the prompt.
